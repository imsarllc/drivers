The driver is heavily based on spidev.  However, instead of requiring
ioctls for full-duplex transfers, It sends the bytes in the provided
read buffer.  This could have reprocussions if, for instance, you are
reusing a buffer or the device does something funny when it receives
all zeros.  However, this is usually safe because you usually need to
send the address to read from the SPI device.


Here is some example C code of how you might read a 16-bit value and
the 16-bit address of 0xbeef:

uint16_t spi_read()
{
  uint8_t buf[4];
  buf[0] = 0xbe;
  buf[1] = 0xef;
  read(spi_fd, buf, 4);
  return (buf[3] << 8 | buf[4]);
}

This driver also requires that you update the device tree if there are
any non-default SPI settings, because there are no ioctls.
